# Elixir Programming Exercises 🌟

Welcome to the Elixir training repository! Elixir is a functional, concurrent programming language built on the Erlang VM, designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. This repository contains 20 exercises aimed at familiarizing you with Elixir's syntax and functional programming concepts, helping you sharpen your skills through practical problem-solving.

## Why Learn a Functional Language? 🧠

Every developer's toolbox should include a variety of languages and paradigms. Understanding a functional programming language like Elixir equips you with powerful tools for solving problems in ways that object-oriented or procedural languages might not, especially in the areas of concurrency, immutability, and data transformation.

## Install Elixir ⚙️

To get started, you need to have Elixir installed on your system. Follow the instructions on the [oficial website](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) to install Elixir for your operating system.
